Sleep is a huge part of all of our lives. The average person spends about a third of their life sleeping, so I think learning more about it is a pretty worthwhile endeavor. With that thought in mind, I found a Kaggle dataset all about Sleep and how different demographic and health factors might influence how much we sleep. Let's dive in!

## Exploratory Data Analysis
There was tons of information for me to glean from this dataset. Though it isn't an incredibly large sample or necessarily representative of all ages and backgrounds, I think that the 374 individuals included give us a substantial amount of data to note some interesting trends. It contains information on each individual's gender, BMI, stress level, blood pressure, sleep disorders, and much more. If you're interested, here's a link to the full [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset). 

But to keep this post brief, I'll focus on only a couple of the insights I found. Specifically, let's look at how age and occupation affect the amount of sleep we get each night.

## Age
I think it's super interesting to see how the average amount of sleep people get changes as they grow older. Based on my data, it appears to fluctuate quite a bit, moving back and forth from less than six to more than eight hours per night on average.

### Occupation
Another very interesting aspect of this data, in my opinion, is that we can see a distinct difference in the amount of sleep people get depending on their occupation. It appears that engineers greatly exceed the suggested seven hours per night, getting about eight hours on average. While sales representatives and scientists, on the other hand, get much less than the recommended amount of sleep, with averages of about six hours per night.
