Sleep is a huge part of all of our lives. The average person spends about a third of their life sleeping, so I think learning more about it is a pretty worthwhile endeavor. With that thought in mind, I found a Kaggle dataset all about Sleep and how different demographic and health factors might influence how much we sleep. Let's dive in!

## Exploratory Data Analysis
There was tons of information for me to glean from this dataset. Though it isn't an incredibly large sample or necessarily representative of all ages and backgrounds, I think that the 374 individuals included give us a substantial amount of data to note some interesting trends. It contains information on each individual's gender, BMI, stress level, blood pressure, sleep disorders, and much more. If you're interested, here's a link to the full [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset). 

But to keep this post brief, I'll focus on only a couple of the insights I found. Specifically, let's look at how age and occupation affect the amount of sleep we get each night.

### Age
I think it's super interesting to see how the average amount of sleep people get changes as they grow older. Based on my data, it appears to fluctuate quite a bit, moving back and forth from less than six to more than eight hours per night on average.

### Occupation
Another very interesting aspect of this data, in my opinion, is that we can see a distinct difference in the amount of sleep people get depending on their occupation. It appears that engineers greatly exceed the suggested seven hours per night, getting about eight hours on average. While sales representatives and scientists, on the other hand, get much less than the recommended amount of sleep, with averages of about six hours per night.

## My Streamlit App
While interesting, these basic plots are very simple and don't display all of the nuances that really affect how much sleep we get. In order to get a better look at how some of our demographic and health differences account for differences in how much we sleep, I put together a streamlit app that looks deeper into more of these variables and explores a few combinations of different ones. 

### Streamlit
For anyone who doesn't already know what Streamlit is, it is a Python library that allows users to develop and launch apps in little time and with little extra effort. Any graph or data that you can create and visualize in python can be exported to the app. Streamlit makes it easy to create sidebars, tabs, and input widgets that make your app interactive and fun for users.

Here's some of the code I used to create my app that could help you in creating your own!

First, I loaded streamlit and all other libraries necessary for this project. If you're using the streamlit cloud to export your app, it's important that you create a github repository for all of your code and files and include all relevent code in a .py file. It's also essential that you include all necessary libraries in a file titles 'requirements.txt' so that the streamlit cloud knows to install them prior to trying to run your code. If you don't do this, you'll likely get annoying errors.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import streamlit as st
from io import BytesIO
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
```

I then used the title function to create a simple title for my app.

```python
st.title('Sleep Data')
```

I decided that I wanted all of my user-accessible widgets to be conveniently located together in a sidebar, so I used the sidebar function to create that. Within it, I included widgets that allow the user to filter charts and data by several of the demographics in the data.

```python
with st.sidebar:
    input_age = st.slider('Age Range', min_value=27, max_value=59, value=(40,50))
    st.text('Gender')
    male_button = st.button('Male')
    female_button = st.button('Female')
    if male_button:
        input_gender = 'Male'
    elif female_button:
        input_gender = 'Female'
    else:
        input_gender = None  # No gender selected yet
    st.write(f"Selected Gender: {input_gender}")
    input_disorder = st.radio('Disorder', ['Sleep Apnea','Insomnia', 'None '])
```

Finally, I created a few tabs to display the different graphs and charts I made,
