## Why Not Just Use Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is a commonly used tool for predictive analysis, and for good reason. The computational efficiency and interpretability of linear regression make for a simple, easy-to-use model.

But this technique also comes with some blind spots. Most real-world relationships don't come in exactly linear patterns, and even with model transformations, linear regression often isn't equipped to deal with all of the complexities inherent in these relationships. That's where Regression Trees come in.
