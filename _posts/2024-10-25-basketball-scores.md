APIs are becoming increasingly common as a way of gathering information. They are simple, efficient, and secure. Sports data is widely viewable, but it can be difficult to ethically find and use it for personal analyses. This is why APIs like "TheRundown" (linked [here](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/therundown-api)), which I'll be using for this analysis, are so useful.
