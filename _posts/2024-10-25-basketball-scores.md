APIs are becoming increasingly common as a way of gathering information. They are simple, efficient, and secure. Sports data is widely viewable, but it can be difficult to ethically find and use for personal analyses. This is why APIs like "TheRundown" (linked [here](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/therundown-api)), are so useful. Using data collected from TheRundown, I will answer the question, which NCAA men's basketball teams and conferences outperformed the rest in the 2023 season?

## Ethics
In gathering data from this website, I made sure to follow several general princibles of ethical data collection. I checked for any terms and policies and was lucky to find that there weren't too many barriers. I signed up for a free subscription which allows me 750 requests per month. This is much more than I needed for this project, so that's been an easy guideline to follow. This API also allows me to share all of the data I collected from it. For transparency purposes, know that all data in my final dataset come from TheRundown, an API found through apilayer.com.
